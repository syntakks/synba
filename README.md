Discord Productivity Bot

You will need to create a config.json file in the root directory:
{
    "token" : "<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>",
    "prefix" : "!", 
    "nasa_key" : "<YOUR_NASA_API_TOKEN>"
}

To get this to work...

Clone the repo. Easiest way is to use github desktop. 

From the command line cd into the project directory.

```npm install```

This will install all the module dependencies for you. 

```node bot.js```

This will start the node server.
